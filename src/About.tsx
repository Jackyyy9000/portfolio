                    Hi, my name is Balazs Kerekgyarto, an aspiring Front-End React Developer. I am <span className="font-normal text-gray-200">passionate about creating slick, user-friendly online experiences</span>  using HTML, CSS, Tailwind, Javascript, Typescript and React. I am dedicated to delivering <span className="font-normal text-gray-200">clean, optimised code,</span> I stay current with the <span className="font-normal text-gray-200">latest development tools and methodologies. </span>
                </p>
                <p className='pb-3'>
                    During my studies, I had become familiar with the fundamentals of web development, and I was certain this was something I wanted to <span className="font-normal text-gray-200">pursue as my career.</span>  Iâ€™ve always been a tech enthusiast, and I always found it important to have visual feedback of my work, which is why <span className="font-normal text-gray-200">Front-End development clicked for me.</span>
                </p>
                <p className='pb-3'>
                    While I was studying and after receiving Secondary School Leaving Certification, I started my career working with CNC machines - first as an operator and then as a programmer. These roles taught me the importance of <span className="font-normal text-gray-200">precision, attention to detail, </span>and<span className="font-normal text-gray-200"> effective time management to meet deadlines.</span> 
                </p>
                <p className='pb-3'>
                    I thrive on hands-on learning as reflected in my portfolio projects below. Beyond coding, I immerse myself in <span className="font-normal text-gray-200">reading, gaming </span>and watching <span className="font-normal text-gray-200">Netflix</span> . Additionally, I enjoy strumming my guitar for musical indulgence, and maintain a regular exercise to keep both my physical and mental faculties sharp. 
                </p>

                    <span className="font-normal text-gray-200">Feel free to explore </span>my projects below to see how I turn ideas into <span className="font-normal text-gray-200">seamless, user-friendly digital experiences.</span>
